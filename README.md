# Personal-Portfolio
My 2023 Personal Portfolio project. Designed to showcase my work as a software developer and act as a personal website. Currently in development.

# Link to Website
The website can be visited [with this link.](https://benporayko.github.io/)
# Goals For This Project
My primary goal for this project is to create a stylish, responsive website to serve as a continually expanding hub for my programming work.
I aim to expand upon the functionality of the website in the following ways:

- [ ] Complete the content sections
- [ ] Complete the About Me section
- [ ] Complete the Contact Me section
- [ ] Add a 'Projects' section
- [ ] Host a downloadable copy of my professional resume
- [ ] Potentially add a blog with CRUD functionality
- [ ] Re-Build Website using a Front-end framework (eg. React)
- [ ] Add a mini-game to the website to showcase programming skills/act as a project in itself??

# Known Issues

- Website is not fully responsive on mobile, specifically in landscape mode
